# Kafka EI Connector

The Kafka [connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI650/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the [Kafka 
Producer API](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerapi) through WSO2 EI and acts as a message producer 
that facilitates message publishing. The Kafka connector sends messages to the Kafka brokers. 

Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that maintains feeds of messages in topics. Producers write
data to topics and consumers read from topics. For more information on Apache Kafka, see [Apache Kafka documentation](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html).
